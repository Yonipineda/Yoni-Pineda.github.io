Twittoff is a machine learning application. You select two Twitter users, type in a message, it can be whatever you want and, the algorithm does its best to predict which of the two individuals chosen is most likely to say the given text.

You also have the option to add a User, so long as their account is not on private. You can also read their current tweets and, delete them from the site.

Below is a quick demo of the app!
