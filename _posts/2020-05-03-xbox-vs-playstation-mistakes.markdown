## A new generation of both these consoles emerge once more, let’s reflect on their history.

We all know, in terms of overall quality, performance, and spec; PC reigns king — also in quantity and quality of games.
But, I happen to have both the Xbox and Playstation console, spanning back to their original release and, throughout the passage of time, have grown both nostalgic and enamored with them.

Their rivalry is known by gamers and relatively modest gaming fans, of how passionate and even at its worst, toxic it can get. Many swear by Playstation; the home of not only some of the greatest exclusive games but, some of the greatest games in history. On the other side, Xbox is beloved and considered the superior console in terms of performance and quality, despite its exclusives being subpar compared with Playstation. Once more, people grow excited in anticipation for the release of the new generation of both these beloved consoles, with fans loyal to their respective console hoping their gaming system will come out victorious in what could be, the last generation of these consoles in the manner we’ve known them — I speculate, of course.

For this analysis, I wanted to explore the history of their competition and the outcome in terms of sales within the previous generations. I also delved a bit deeper into why a certain console performed better than the other, looking at their exclusive’s, specs, and public reception. Perhaps, upon reflection we can get a good idea on what fans liked and what gave the winning console its victory.
Without any further delay, let’s look at some stats and data, maybe even build a clearer picture of what qualities the next gen consoles should strive to hit in order to be the favorite among fans, and the general community.

## Console OS Market Share: WorldWide and North-America.

Let’s take a quick look at how the two stacked up against each other in the global market:

<small>Further illustration of Playstation dominance in the Global Market.</small>

For the majority of the given timeline, Playstation is dominant in the global market share. In the beginning of the timeline, Playstation at its max obtains %91.69 of the global market share while Xbox has %0, that is misleading due to the fact that no data was given for Xbox in the time spanning from 8/2012–4/2013. Around 8/2017 we see, a dramatic overtake by Xbox in the market share but, it is short lived. The United States market share is also similar to the global market:

In the US, Playstation is on top for the majority of the timeline, only different in that the gap in market share is smaller.
By looking at the information provided above, we can tell that Playstation was, in terms of market share, the winning console. But, this does not tell us why Playstation has been on top. In order to try to find some explanation, we’ll have to dig a bit deeper into their contents.

## Qualities of a Winning Console
<medium>Cost, Games, Genre, Rating, and Sales.</medium>

Let’s dive deep into each of the categories listed above, in hopes of illuminating a clearer picture of how each platform did, we may come to find some patterns — that in truth, are quite obvious without the need of analyzing them but nonetheless, gamers and the general community look for in a console before spending their rent money.

### How much does it cost?

Let’s look at my basic table:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/console/console_price.png)
<small>Data Source: [IGN Data](https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/comparing-the-price-of-every-game-console-with-inflation).</small>

And a horizontal bar graph, for further clarity:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/console/hor_bar_price.png)

The golden price seems to be from $299-$399. The exception being the PS3[($599)](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/ps3-launch-price-was-a-mistake-sony-studios-boss-1881734) and the Xbox One[($499)](https://www.newsweek.com/xbox-series-x-news-price-specs-console-1477105), which can be a reasonable increase in price if the order of magnitude in its innovation is substantial enough to merit such a price. For most people, that kind of money is crazy money. Certainly for me it is, so if the new generation of consoles exceeds the ‘golden price’, which I assume it will, they got to deliver the goods.

### PS4 vs XboxOne: What sells?
<small>Data source for this section: [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings)</small>

To begin with this section, I quickly want to go over the current generation of the Playstation and Xbox: The PS4 and Xbox One.

<small>Year of release and Platform(aka: The two consoles) aggregated then summed by global sales.</small>

It’s clear that the PS4 exceeds the Xbox One in global sales. Now, we search for some explanation as to why that is:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/console/xb1_vs_ps4_2.png)
<small>Rating and Platform aggregated then summed by Global sales.</small>

A key differentiation is that PS4 seems to have catered to both hardcore gamers and family-friendly people. Their ability to provide games for both Mature and rated E(everyone) tells us a reason why they’re dominant is due to the fact that they provide for these two separate yet high in demand groups.
Now let’s look at what the genre of a game can tell us:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/console/per_game_xb1_ps4.png)
<small>Genre and Platform aggregated then summed by Global sales.</small>

This is a confirmation of the previous graph, in the sense that the PS4 has the majority of the sales in 10/12 genres — one of which, that being the ‘Puzzle’ genre has no data on either console.
To wrap the PS4 vs. Xbox One segment, let’s look at my modest, yet telling Pie Graph:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/console/pie_chart_1.png)

You’ll have to squint your eyes or zoom in, sorry, but if there was any confusion as to which console within the current generation was most dominant, this pie graph should settle it.

### All Generations of Both Consoles: Again, What sells?
<small>Data source: [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings)</small>

Lastly, we’ll take a look at all the generations, included in the dataset, of the Playstation and Xbox. Let’s take a look:

<small>Year of release and Platform aggregated then summed by sales: Includes all Generations of both Console OS. Stacked BarPlot.</small>

Throughout the lapse of time, even before I inhaled my first breath of air, Playstation has had the upper hand over Xbox for the majority of time. To be fair, Playstation released their first console in 1995 while Xbox released their first in 2001. Yet, it remains true that Playstation has been the dominant console, with the exception from 2008–2012, which shows strong competition between PS3 and Xbox 360. If you look at my bar graph showcasing each Platform and its release price, you’ll see that the PS3 was far too expensive. That may be a variable as to why Playstation started to slack.

Next, let’s at what the game ratings can tell us, just as we did with the PS4/XboxOne comparison:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/console/colorful_bar2.png)
<small>Rating and Platform aggregated then summed by Global sales: Includes all Generations of both Console OS.</small>

Generally speaking, both consoles seem to cater more towards mature/hardcore player-base kind of games. Although, Playstation seems to remember to feed the younglings and the pure, providing more content for rated E(everyone) games than Xbox.

Now we look at the genre as well:

Genre and Platform aggregated then summed by Global sales: All generations of both console’s included. Stacked BarPlot.
A heavy inclination towards games more likely to be rated M(mature). It supports the previous graph, meaning Playstation demonstrates to cater to many groups among the gaming community.

Lastly, let’s wrap it up with a Pie graph. Modest yet telling:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/console/pie_chart2.png)

Zoom in, the dominance of Playstation isn’t as vivid as the previous Pie Graph, yet it still holds true that the Playstation has a greater grasp on the community.

## A new generation is coming: Which should you buy?
If you are a long time fan or have general familiarity with both these console’s and have wavered in opinions in regards to which console is best, It would be best to wait until more information of the new consoles come out. If you are the kind of person who is particularly interested in the technical aspects of a console, I suggest you get a PC. If you are someone who has never owned a console, It would be wise to choose the one most affordable for you and where most of your friends play.

As to the two giants, Playstation(Sony) and Xbox(Microsoft), it has become more evident that the gaming industry is experiencing an exponential growth. People are making a great living out of it, from Streamers, Youtubers, Competitive Gamers, and much more. Don’t abandon single player games, some of the best games to come out recently are part of that category. History cannot speak for the future, but it does tell us what did work in its time. People tend to like companies that are consumer-friendly, make great games, cater to different audiences, affordable and/or a substantial amount of innovation in order to justify an increase in price.
