Hi, my name is Yoni Pineda! Thanks for taking a glance at my page. Im a Data Science student at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). This website will serve as a documentation of my development as a programmer and a place to show off the cool things I've been able to build since starting at [Lambda](https://lambdaschool.com/).

Prior to joining [Lambda](https://lambdaschool.com/), I had no coding experience. In this page, I'll introduce myself a bit, going over my 'Before Lambda', what I like to do, what I've done, and what Im hoping to be able to be doing not too long from now.

#### A Brief Hello!
<small>Prior to [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)</small>

Im 20 years old and living in Maryland. After High-School, I traveled to LA for the experience. My visit was brief but, those couple of months were eventful and went by in a flash. I worked odd jobs, ranging from Customer Service, Photography and a few art pieces I managed to sell, and as an Insurance Broker.

Besides programming, I draw with pencil and Charcoal, spend my mornings and afternoons reading, without fail and, I enjoy speed-running two particular games, Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1.

#### About Lambda
<small> December 3rd, 2019 - On-Going</small>

Lambda offers several different [courses](https://lambdaschool.com/curriculum), such as [Data-Science](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science), [Web Development](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/full-stack-web-development), and [IOS-Development](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/ios-development). As for their schedule, they offer two options, [Full-Time](https://lambdaschool.com/curriculum) and [Part-Time](https://lambdaschool.com/curriculum).

I enrolled in the [Data-Science](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science) for [Full-Time](https://lambdaschool.com/curriculum).

Before I even knew about Lambda, I had interest in Machine-Learning and when the Youtube Algorithm showed me Lambdas famous [AD Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLdXxFS8BV4), I checked out their website and saw they offered a Data-Science course and [ISA](https://lambdaschool.com/isa) option, which in it's simplest form means we, the students, pay no tuition-upfront.

Im currently in [Labs](https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/how-lambda-school-labs-works-whiteboard-friday), working with a fully stacked team in order to create a worthy app. Since starting, I've created several apps and written a few blogs about some Data-science related subject. Check it out in the home page!

#### Post Lambda
<small>On-Going - ??</small>

Im nearing the end of the 9 month curriculum, and while its true that i've come far since joining, with no experience in coding, I realize just how vast this world of programming is and Im only looking to get my hands on more projects and subjects. I plan to start the job search soon, feel free to contact me for any inquiry by clicking on any of the links below!

Thank you for stopping by !
