Hi, my name is Yoni Pineda! Thanks for taking a glance at my page. Im a Data Science student at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). This website will serve as a documentation of my development as a programmer and a place to show off the cool things I've been able to build since starting at [Lambda](https://lambdaschool.com/).

Prior to joining [Lambda](https://lambdaschool.com/), I had no coding experience. In this page, I'll introduce myself a bit, going over my 'Before Lambda', what I like to do, what I've done, and what Im hoping to be able to be doing not too long from now.
