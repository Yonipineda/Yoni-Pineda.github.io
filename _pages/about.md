Hi, my name is Yoni Pineda! Thanks for taking a glance at my page. Im a Data Science student at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). This website will serve as a documentation of my development as a programmer and a place to show off the cool things I've been able to build since starting at [Lambda](https://lambdaschool.com/).

Prior to joining [Lambda](https://lambdaschool.com/), I had no coding experience. In this page, I'll introduce myself a bit, going over my 'Before Lambda', what I like to do, what I've done, and what Im hoping to be able to be doing not too long from now.

#### A Brief Hello!
<small>Prior to [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)</small>

A brief introduction about me, Im 20 years old and living in Maryland. After I graduated from High-school, I traveled for nearly two years across America, alone and free. I worked various odd jobs across LA, San Francisco, Idaho, Maine, New York, and North Carolina. From Photography, Uber and DoorDasher, Insurance Broker, Freelance Drawing-- on rare occasions, and good old Customer Service. Now, I spend most of my time sitting on a chair and coding until I break everything and go to sleep in agony.
